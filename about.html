    <p>Hi! Welcome to my website! Here's a little bit about me.</p>

    <p>
        My full name is Takanao Ishimura, but most of the time I go by Taki. I was born in Fukuoka, Japan, but have
        lived most of my life in Bar Harbor, Maine. Got my bachelors in computer science at the University of
        Pennsylvania in 2022, worked as software engineer at AWS on a real time data-streaming
        platform called Kinesis for a couple years, and am currently trying to build an online 3D voxel art platform
        called CornerSpace.

        The reason why I like computer science so much is because it gives you the ability to create amazing things from
        pretty much nothing but a little bit of electricity and some well thought out lines of code. Especially in the
        land of graphics, you can see your ideas come to life in a visually gripping way, which I find so neat. On top
        of that, the scope of hard problems within the field of cs in general is boundless, and I really appreciate the
        bottom-up, rigorous, from first-principles approach necessary to take when trying to solve these challenging
        problems as a software engineer.
    </p>

        In my free time, there's so much that I like to do, and so much more that I want to do. I stay active by skating
        and playing soccer and badminton. I really like to make music, and have been getting back into violin playing
        after a long hiatus. I don't like to cook for myself, but I love cooking for my family and friends. I make a
        mean mushroom risotto.

        I always like connecting with new people, so if you want, shoot me an email at ishimurataki@gmail.com!
